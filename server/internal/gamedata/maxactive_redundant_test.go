// TestMaxActiveIsRedundantInShippedData is why `MaxActive` (spell record field 8)
// is decoded but deliberately NOT enforced.
//
// The client's model is clear enough to implement: the counter is `sH.akV` on the
// per-fighter cast-history tracker, keyed by spell id, checked against the TARGET
// (`mv_1` runs cooldown/per-turn against the caster's `sH` but calls the
// max-active check on `gn_03`, which the following line proves is the target),
// incremented on cast by `d()` and decremented by `e()`. No wire work is involved:
// the decrement is driven by `amt_2`, which looks like a packet (it extends
// `yd_2`) but has `TI()` returning 0, EMPTY serialization bodies and no opcode —
// a client-local timeline event.
//
// The reason not to implement it is that in the shipped data it can never change
// an outcome. Its decay window is ONE TURN — `mv_1` schedules the decrement with
// `arm_0.lQ(1)`, a literal, and the very next line schedules a different event
// with `arm_0.lQ(fv2.et())`, i.e. a spell-derived duration, so the literal is
// deliberate. A counter that resets every turn is exactly the granularity
// `CastMaxPerTarget` already has.
//
// And every shipped MaxActive spell is already capped at least as tightly by a
// limit the server DOES enforce: five of the six have
// `CastMaxPerTarget == MaxActive`, and the sixth (spell 8) is a range-0 self-cast
// already limited to one cast per turn.
//
// Enforcing it would therefore add a second, subtly different gate that changes
// no legal cast — and getting the window wrong would REJECT casts the client
// believes are legal, which is a visible regression. If this test ever fails, a
// spell has appeared whose MaxActive really does bind tighter than the limits we
// enforce, and it becomes worth implementing.
