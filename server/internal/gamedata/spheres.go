// spheres.go decodes the SPHERE BOARD - the "Kanodo" (client string `sphereboard`)
// - from record types 900 (boards, client class `bg_0`) and 901 (nodes, `aeI`).
//
// The Kanodo is a per-fighter talent tree, and the client's own help text
// (content.59.53) is the clearest statement of the mechanic: a board is made of
// spheres BOUGHT with the experience a fighter has earned. A sphere can only be
// bought if it has a direct path to the sphere the progression cursor currently
// sits on - the cursor being drawn as the fighter's own head. Buying one grants
// its payload: a characteristic bonus, a new spell, or a set of equipment the
// fighter may then wear. Some spheres are deliberately a MALUS, "a sacrifice a
// fighter must make to continue its learning". Portal spheres teleport the cursor
// elsewhere on the board, and barrier spheres demand a card be sacrificed to open
// the way.
//
// What the client does and does not own here matters for the server's job:
//
//   - The board LAYOUT is client-side data. `vj_2`/`dq_1` load these same records
//     out of the client's own data files and register them in `akp_1`, so the
//     server never sends the graph.
//   - The fighter's PROGRESS is server state, and the fighter blob already carries
//     it: `[i32 sphereBoardId][i32 xp][i32 totalXp] ... [i16 sphereX][i16 sphereY]
//     [i16 sphereCount]{[i32 sphereId]}` (see game/fighter_codec.go). The cursor is
//     that (sphereX, sphereY) pair and the list is the bought nodes - `ee_2.NE()`
//     on the client side.
//   - Buying is C2S 23009 (`aow_2`, arch 3): [i64 fighterId][i32 sphereId]
//     [i32 cardTemplateId], the card being the barrier sacrifice and 0 otherwise.
//
// The node's TYPE (Bonus / Malus / Spell / Item / Summon / Teleport / Barrier /
// DeadEnd) is NOT stored: `ayr_0.aKZ()` derives it from the node's own contents -
// a spell id makes it a Spell, otherwise the FIRST effect's action id is matched
// against fixed sets. So this package stores what the record holds and leaves the
// classification to whoever needs it.
