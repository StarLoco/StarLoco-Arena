// TestStatesTargetedBy149AreSingleSourced pins the data property that lets
// internal/game/states.go get away with a SINGLE-VALUED stateSrc map
// (state -> the effect id that set it).
//
// The client does not model states that way. A fighter's states live in the
// refcounted store Kt (gn_0.baR, an aLM extends Kt): g() increments a per-key
// byte, h() decrements and deletes at zero, c() reads the count. There is no
// duration in that store at all — only "how many sources are applying this".
// Our map instead holds remaining TURNS and keeps max(existing, new), so two
// overlapping sources collapse into one entry and one remembered effect id.
//
// That divergence is only OBSERVABLE if something removes one source of a
// multi-source state early, and the only mechanism that removes a state by
// source is action 149. This test asserts the property that makes that
// unreachable: every state effect id targeted by a 149 is the ONLY source of
// its state in the whole spell table.
//
// Overlap itself is real and shipped — spell 419 applies five states at
// duration 63, and spells 147 and 170 each apply `rooted` twice in one cast
// (170 with two different durations) — so this is a genuine property of which
// states 149 touches, not an accident of there being no overlap anywhere.
//
// If this test ever fails, the max()-and-last-writer model is no longer safe
// and states must become properly source-counted, the way Kt does it.
