// consumables.go — using a consumable coach card ON a living fighter
// (FIGHTER_USE_ITEM 22099, the "drop a card onto a fighter" gesture).
//
// This is the maintenance half of the META layer: 325 of the 907 coach cards are
// marked usable, and they are how a coach repairs a roster between fights —
// healing wounds, clearing fatigue, lifting morale, granting a blessing.
// Resurrection (AI 13) is handled separately in handlers_evolution.go because it
// is the only one that acts on a DEAD fighter.
//
// Each action's behaviour is transcribed from the client class that implements
// it. Note that every one of these classes has TWO methods: the passive
// `a(et_2)` path, which only annotates the post-fight report, and the consumable
// path, which mutates the fighter for real. We implement the latter here.
