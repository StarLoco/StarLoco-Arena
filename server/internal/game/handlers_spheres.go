// handlers_spheres.go implements buying a Sphere Board ("Kanodo") node.
//
// The client applies the purchase to its own copy of the fighter and then tells
// the server (`awu_0`), rather than asking first: there is no reply opcode and no
// rejection path. That shapes what this handler is for. It is not a second
// opinion the player sees - it is the authority on what gets PERSISTED, and the
// client's optimistic copy is discarded on the next roster push either way.
//
// So every rule the client enforces is re-derived here from the server's own
// state, never trusted from the packet. A crafted 23009 is otherwise a free
// talent tree: the fighter id, the sphere id and the sacrificed card all arrive
// as raw numbers.

	// refunded while the fighter_spheres rows (a different table, never touched by
	// SaveProgress) survived. Queue a ranked or evolution fight, buy nodes while
	// it runs, repeat: entire boards for nothing.
