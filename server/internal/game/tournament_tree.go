// The tournament bracket (28649 request / 28650 reply).
//
// The client models the bracket as a 1-INDEXED BINARY HEAP and slices it into
// rounds by slot range (`ah_1.getFieldValue`):
//
//	slot 1      winner
//	slots 2-3   finale
//	slots 4-7   semiFinale
//	slots 8-15  quarterFinal
//	slots 16-31 firstRound
//
// so a full tree is 16 first-round entrants and 31 slots, and the winner of
// slots 2i / 2i+1 occupies slot i. Nothing about that is negotiable - the ranges
// are hard-coded in the client - which is why the bracket is built to fit it
// rather than the other way round.
//
// Names are UTF-8 here (`new String(byArray2, "UTF-8")`), NOT the windows-1252
// the rest of this protocol uses (B-068). Sending cp1252 would mangle any
// accented coach name in the bracket only.

// (B-122).
