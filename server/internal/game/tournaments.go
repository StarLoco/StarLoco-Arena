// Tournaments in 2.70 are scheduled events. The tournament totem (or the calendar
// menu button) opens a window that fires two empty requests — the calendar (17002)
// and the tournament list (28601) — and the server answers with the events (17003)
// and the registerable tournaments (28602). Clicking "register" sends 4607, which
// we accept with 28608; the bracket button sends 28649, answered by an empty tree
// (28650).
//
// This server offers a set of STANDING tournaments that are always open for
// registration. The live-match layer — opponent search, scheduled fights, bracket
// progression and rewards — is the deferred deep part (it needs many coaches and
// wall-clock scheduling); registration here just records intent and reports it back.
//
// The line-up lives in the database (domain.Tournament) and is edited from the web
// admin console, so changing it no longer needs a rebuild. A fresh database is
// seeded with the three that used to be compiled in.
//
// Each tournament references a REAL client definition id (a data.bdat type-1000
// `aub` record; the retail client ships 22 of them, ids {1,4..24}). The client's
// list/detail/register code dereferences that definition unguarded, so a row whose
// defId is not one of those 22 would NPE the client, and only definitions whose
// inscription card is 0 can ever complete registration here. Both rules are
// enforced where tournaments are created — see internal/web's validateTournament,
// which checks them against the decoded catalogue before anything reaches a player.

// tournamentWindow is how long a standing tournament stays on the calendar / open
// for registration, measured from "now" at request time.
const tournamentWindow = 7 * 24 * time.Hour

// tournamentContentTypeID is the client content id whose prototype decodes a
// tournament calendar entry (data.bdat type-700 record id 4 -> class qr_0). A 17003
// entry must lead with a registered content id or the client's awa_0 decoder NPEs.
