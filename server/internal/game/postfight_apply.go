// baseXPPerFight is the XP a fight is worth before any modifier.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: this number is NOT recoverable from the client. `adl_0` receives
// `baseXp` already computed (the client only ever *reads* `cnr`), so the real
// server's formula for it is not in `core.jar`. Everything the value then flows
// through IS client-exact; only this seed is ours. It is deliberately a single
// named constant so it can be replaced the moment evidence turns up, rather than
// being smeared through the code.
//
// Chosen so that a fighter at neutral morale needs a plausible number of fights
// to clear level 1 (860 XP → ~9 fights) rather than to feel tuned.
// baseXPPerFight moved to Rules.BaseXPPerFight (configurable). The constant is\n// gone deliberately: leaving it would let a call site silently bypass config.

// timeChallengeXPPerTurn mirrors the one XP rule the client DOES compute itself
// (WE.java, time challenges): turns/2 rounded両 ways, times the challenge's own
// multiplier. Not used yet — recorded here so the next person does not re-derive
// it. See docs/DATA-COVERAGE.md.

// deathIsRolledNotDealt records WHY being downed does not kill a fighter, since
// the opposite is the intuitive guess and was what this server did until B-097.
//
// Permanent death in evolution mode is a per-fighter PROBABILITY, computed from
// that fighter's own lifetime XP (`adl_0.atd()`: death% = (totalXp/1000)²/100)
// and spent at the end of the fight. It has no HP input anywhere. Four
// independent pieces of the client say a KO is not a death:
//
//   - `fightEndAchievementDeathDescriptionFailed` — "vous n'avez pas occasionné
//     de MORT DÉFINITIVE chez les combattants adverses". You down the enemy team
//     to win, so if downing killed, this string could never be shown after a win.
//     The client also distinguishes the two words: `fight.die` ("[#1] est mort")
//     is the in-fight KO, "mort définitive" is the permanent one.
//   - `content.29.301` — "et un grand nombre de BLESSURES peut provoquer la
//     mort". Death is the terminal stage of an injury/fatigue chain, reached
//     over many fights, not the consequence of one knockdown.
//   - `bf_1.b` (the wound roller) kills only on an upgrade roll landing while the
//     fighter ALREADY holds 3 serious wounds — again cumulative, never HP-driven.
//   - Opcode 4520 `FighterDiesMessage` (`cd_2`) carries a bare fighter id and no
//     permanence flag, and NO client code links HP==0 to `isDead()`/state 2.
//
// So the two real death paths — the quadratic XP roll and the 3-serious-wounds
// escalation — are both already implemented (B-066), and the HP<=0 override we
// used to run on top of them was invented, not derived. It fired for exactly the
// fighters most likely to be affected and hid the modelled mechanic completely.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: `adl_0.atd()` and `bf_1.b` have no callers in the client (they
// are server logic shipped inside core.jar), so we cannot prove from the client
// whether retail ran the roll for every fielded fighter or gated it on some
// participation test. We roll for every fielded fighter. What the evidence does
// settle is that a KO does not REPLACE the roll with certain death.
