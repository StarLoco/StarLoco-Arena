// Versioned schema migrations.
//
// The server supports three dialects (sqlite, postgres, mysql), which is what
// decides the shape of this file. Hand-frozen `CREATE TABLE` SQL would have to
// exist three times and drift three ways, so the baseline is expressed through
// GORM's own migrator instead: portable by construction, and identical to what
// every existing database was built with.
//
// What this adds over the bare `AutoMigrate` call it replaces:
//
//   - a `schema_migrations` table recording which steps have run, so a database
//     has a KNOWN version instead of "whatever the models happened to say";
//   - ordered, one-shot steps, each in its own transaction, so a step that fails
//     leaves no half-applied schema and is retried on the next start;
//   - somewhere to put the things AutoMigrate cannot express - dropping or
//     renaming a column, backfilling a row - which is the reason this item
//     existed at all.
//
// AutoMigrate remains the BASELINE step (version 1) rather than being deleted.
// It is additive-only and idempotent, so re-running it against a database built
// by the old code adopts that database unchanged, which is what makes this
// upgrade safe for every operator who already has an `arena.db`. The honest cost
// of that choice: step 1 is defined against the LIVE models, so a purely additive
// model change still lands without a numbered migration. The moment a change is
// destructive - or must be ordered against a data fix - it needs its own entry
// here, and from then on the version number is what tells you where a database
// stands.

// schemaMigration is the bookkeeping row. Deliberately store-private: nothing
// outside migration control should read or write it.
