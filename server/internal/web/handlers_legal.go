// The legal pages exist because this project runs a public service built on
// somebody else's intellectual property, and the honest way to do that is to
// say so on the site rather than only in a file on GitHub that no player reads.
//
// Three pages, all public and all crawlable:
//
//   - /legal   — non-affiliation, whose IP this is, and how a rights holder
//     gets material removed without needing a lawyer.
//   - /privacy — the GDPR notice. The portal is operated from the EU and holds
//     account records, so this is not optional.
//   - /terms   — what a player is agreeing to, and what gets them banned.
//
// They carry no state beyond the contact address, so they share one model.

// legalVersion and legalUpdated stamp the three documents.
//
// An undated policy cannot be relied on: neither the operator nor a player can
// later show which terms applied when. Both peers in this space and the GDPR's
// own transparency guidance treat a version + effective date as part of the
// document rather than decoration.
//
// Bump both together whenever the substance changes, not for a typo.
