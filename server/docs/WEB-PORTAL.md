# Web portal

The browser site bundled with the server: where players register, see everything
the server stores about them, and where operators run the game from.

It lives in **`internal/web`** and is **Go stdlib + `html/template` only** — no
Node toolchain, no build step, no framework, no CDN. Templates, the stylesheet,
two webfonts and the favicon are `//go:embed`-ed, so the whole site ships inside
the binary and works on a machine with no internet access.

## 1. Running it

The portal runs **inside `cmd/server`**, sharing its process and its `*store.Store`.
That is deliberate rather than incidental:

- the live tiles (players online, active fights) read the real registries;
- the monitoring page profiles *this* runtime, so there is no second,
  unauthenticated debug port to leave open.

It is on by default and needs no configuration. `web.enabled: false` turns it
off; accounts are then created with `go run ./cmd/seedaccount`.

## 2. Configuration (`web:` block)

```yaml
web:
  enabled: true
  addr: "0.0.0.0:0"          # 0 = pick a port: 80, 8080, 8090, 3000, 5000, any
  registration_enabled: true
  server_name: "My Arena"    # branding; empty = "DofusArena"
  public_host: ""            # address shown to players; empty = the host they used
  client_download_url: "..." # empty hides the download link
  min_login_length: 3
  min_password_length: 6
  session_secret: ""         # empty = random per start (everyone signed out on restart)
  secure_cookies: false      # true ONLY behind https
```

Two of these bite if you get them wrong:

- **`session_secret`** is a credential. Empty is fine for a home server, it just
  means a restart signs everyone out. Set it (or `ARENA_WEB_SESSION_SECRET`) in
  production; anyone who learns it can forge a login for any account.
- **`secure_cookies: true` on a plain-HTTP server makes signing in silently
  impossible** — the browser accepts the cookie and then refuses to send it
  back, so every login looks like it "did nothing". It stays off by default.

## 3. Pages

Public — no account needed:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Landing page. Redirects a signed-in visitor to `/account`. |
| `GET /status` | Is the server up, is anyone playing. **Aggregate counts only** — no player or account names — because anyone on the internet can read it. |
| `GET /ladder` | The public 1v1 leaderboard, paginated. Shows what the in-game ladder already shows every player. |
| `GET\|POST /login`, `GET\|POST /register`, `POST /logout` | |
| `GET /health` | `ok`, for uptime checks. |

Signed in, any account:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GET /account` | Everything stored about you: coach, ladder record, wallet, fighters (with spell/item/wound counts), teams, equipped cards, bag, friends, ignored, mail count, statistics. |
| `GET\|POST /account/password` | Change password. Requires the current one. |

Admin only — gated on the **real** signed-in account being `is_admin`:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GET /admin` | Tiles (accounts, players online, active fights, uptime) + newest accounts. |
| `GET /admin/accounts` | Searchable, paginated. Search matches the **account or the coach name**, since most players only know each other by the latter. |
| `GET\|POST /admin/accounts/new` | Create an account, optionally as an admin. |
| `GET /admin/accounts/{id}` | The same deep view the player sees, plus moderation. |
| `POST /admin/accounts/{id}/delete` | Deletes the account and everything under it. Refused while connected. |
| `POST /admin/accounts/{id}/toggle-admin` | Grant/revoke admin. |
| `POST /admin/accounts/{id}/impersonate` | Start viewing the site as that player. |
| `GET /admin/tournaments` | The standing tournaments players see. Create, edit, reorder, hide or delete. |
| `GET\|POST /admin/tournaments/new` | |
| `GET\|POST /admin/tournaments/{id}` | Edit. |
| `POST /admin/tournaments/{id}/delete` `.../toggle` | Delete, or hide without losing the setup. |
| `GET /admin/monitoring` | Runtime stats + the profiler. |
| `GET /admin/monitoring/pprof/{profile}` | One profile, served from this process. |
| `POST /impersonate/stop` | Not admin-gated: whoever is impersonating must always be able to get back to themselves. |

The account view is **one template** (`_partials.html` → `account_data`) shared by
the player's page and the admin's, so the two cannot drift apart: an admin sees
exactly what the player sees, plus the controls.

## 4. Security model

**Sessions** (`session.go`) are HMAC-SHA256 **signed, not encrypted** — the
payload is `accountID.impersonatedID.issuedUnix`, which holds nothing secret, so
integrity is the only property needed. Crucially the cookie is never used as a
cache: every request re-loads the account from the database, so a deleted or
demoted user is handled on their next click rather than at their next login.
7-day TTL, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`.

### Tournament editing is the one dangerous form

Everywhere else in this console a careless save annoys somebody. Here it can
take every connected client down, so the rules are enforced rather than
documented.

A tournament row carries a **client definition id** — a `data.bdat` type-1000
`aub` record. The retail client ships 22 of them (ids 1 and 4–24) and
dereferences the id **unguarded**: `LS.Yf().gG(defId)` returns null for anything
else and the list/detail/register code walks straight into it. On top of that, a
definition whose inscription card is non-zero makes the client demand an entry
ticket this server never grants, so registration can never complete.

Both rules are checked against the decoded catalogue in `validateTournament`,
and the form only ever offers definitions that satisfy them — the picker shows
20 of the 22, labelled with the team type the client will read (`1 — classic
1v1`, `17 — graveyard`). With no game data loaded the catalogue is empty and the
id is taken on trust, because refusing to let an operator edit tournaments at
all because `data_dir` is missing would be worse.

Name and short label are capped at 127 bytes. That is the wire, not taste: both
are length-prefixed with a **signed** byte, so 128 presents as a negative length
and the client's decoder throws.

**CSRF** (`csrf.go`) is a signed per-account double-submit token: an HMAC over
the account id plus a day bucket, embedded in every state-changing form and
re-derived on POST. Keyed with the same secret as sessions, so it cannot be
minted; bound to the account id, so it cannot be replayed across users. The
previous day's bucket is also accepted, so a form left open over midnight still
submits. GET never mutates, so only POSTs verify.

**Impersonation** keeps *both* identities in the session. `requireAdmin` only
ever looks at the **real** one, so viewing-as grants a view and never a
privilege, and the impersonated session is **read-only** — an admin cannot
change the password of somebody they are impersonating. A banner with a
one-click way out is shown on every page.

**Self-harm guards.** An admin cannot delete or demote the account they are
signed in as: on a one-admin server that would lock the console for good.
Deleting a *connected* account is refused too, because the game server is
holding that coach in memory and would keep saving it back.

**Rate limits.** Sign-up and sign-in have separate allowances (10/hour and
20/15min per address) because the right number differs by an order of magnitude:
ten new accounts an hour from one address is suspicious, ten mistyped passwords
in an evening is not. Proxy headers are ignored — they are attacker-controlled
unless a known proxy rewrites them, and trusting them would defeat the limit.

**CSP** is `default-src 'none'` with **no `script-src` at all**. The site has no
JavaScript, so this is a real mitigation rather than a formality: a stored-XSS
bug in something like a coach name could not execute.

## 5. Monitoring and pprof

Served **in-process** rather than reverse-proxied to a separate listener (which
is what the v2.04 portal did, because it could run as its own process). Only six
named profiles are reachable — `goroutine`, `heap`, `allocs`, `threadcreate`,
`block`, `mutex`. Requests never fall through to `net/http/pprof`'s own mux, so
there is no path to `cmdline` (which leaks the command line) or to the CPU
profile's `seconds` parameter, which would let a caller hold a request open for
as long as they liked.

## 6. Theme

A dark, warm-black ground (`#0a0806`) with a single amber accent (`#fa9e19`),
following the visual language of the modern Dofus Arena fan sites. The
distinctive parts:

- **borders are never grey** — always the accent at 15% opacity;
- **depth comes from a faint amber grid texture and large blurred colour blobs**,
  not from grey drop shadows;
- every section is announced by an **eyebrow**: a short amber rule followed by
  small uppercase letter-spaced accent text;
- hover is a 2–4px lift plus an amber glow.

**Fonts** are Sora (headings) and Outfit (body), bundled as **variable** woff2 in
the latin subset — 57 KB for both, one file per family covering every weight the
site uses. They are self-hosted rather than fetched from a CDN so the portal
works offline and the CSP can keep `font-src 'self'`. Both are SIL Open Font
License; see `internal/web/static/fonts/LICENSE.md`.

Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 7. Tests

- `web_test.go` — public pages render, the status page leaks no names, the
  fonts are actually embedded and are valid woff2, registration/validation/
  duplicate/closed-registration, both rate limiters, cross-origin rejection,
  the listener ladder, clean shutdown, and a guard that every template parses.
- `session_test.go` — codec round-trip, tampering, foreign-key and expiry
  rejection, ephemeral-key behaviour, CSRF per-account and day-bucket rules.
- `portal_test.go` — drives the site over a real socket with a cookie jar:
  login/logout, the account page with and without a coach, password change
  (including the CSRF requirement), admin gating for anonymous and ordinary
  players, console rendering, search, pprof, create/delete/grant, the self-harm
  guards, the connected-account refusal, impersonation both ways, and a session
  whose account was deleted.

Four security properties are **mutation-checked** — dropping the `IsAdmin`
check, gating on the effective instead of the real account, making `verifyCSRF`
always return true, and allowing the password change while impersonating each
fail a specific named test.
