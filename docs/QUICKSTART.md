# DofusArena 2.70 server - quick start

Run your own DofusArena 2 server. No setup, no database to install, no
configuration to write.

## 1. Start the server

**Windows** - double-click `arena-server.exe`.

> Windows may show *"Windows protected your PC"*. That appears for any program
> without a paid code-signing certificate. Click **More info -> Run anyway**.
> If you would rather check first, compare the file against `checksums.txt`
> (see the bottom of this page).

**Linux / macOS** - open a terminal in this folder and run:

```
chmod +x arena-server
./arena-server
```

> macOS may say the app "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified
> developer". Right-click the file -> **Open** -> **Open**, or run
> `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine arena-server` once.

You will see something like:

```
  DofusArena 2.70 server v0.1.0

  Game server   0.0.0.0:5555
  Web portal    http://localhost:8080

  Settings written to config.yaml - edit it and restart to change anything.
  Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

**Leave this window open** while you play. `Ctrl + C` stops the server.

The server just created two files next to itself:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `config.yaml` | Every setting, explained. Edit it and restart. |
| `arena.db` | The database: accounts, coaches, teams. **This is your save - back it up.** |

## 2. Create your account

Open the **web portal** address the server printed (usually
<http://localhost> or <http://localhost:8080>) and fill in the form.

> The **first account created becomes the administrator** of the server. If
> that should be you, register before anyone else does.

## 3. The game data

The card, spell and arena data fights need is already in the `data` folder next
to `arena-server` - nothing to do here. The startup message confirms it:

```
  Game data     907 cards, 203 spells, 47 arenas
                from /path/to/arena-server/data
```

Playing with your own instead (e.g. after a client update)? Point `--data` at
your DofusArena folder (the one with `DofusArena.exe` in it), or set `data_dir`
in `config.yaml` to the same path - either replaces the bundled copy.

Note that this is the **server's own data** (card/spell/arena records), not the
playable game - see the next step for that.

## 4. Connect with the game client

1. Open `game/config.properties` in your DofusArena client folder.
2. Find `proxyAddresses_1` and set it to your server:
   - same computer: `proxyAddresses_1=127.0.0.1:5555,127.0.0.1:5555`
   - another computer: `proxyAddresses_1=192.168.1.20:5555,192.168.1.20:5555`
     (use the server machine's address)
3. Start `DofusArena.exe` and log in with the account you registered.

Your coach is created inside the game the first time you connect.

The web portal shows the exact address your players should use - just send them
the portal link and they can register and read it themselves.

## Playing with friends

- **Same house / same Wi-Fi:** friends use your computer's local address
  (e.g. `192.168.1.20:5555`). Nothing else to do.
- **Over the internet:** forward TCP port `5555` (and the web portal port) on
  your router to the machine running the server. Treat this as you would any
  other program you expose - see `DISCLAIMER.md` and the security notes in the
  project repository.

## Common problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| *"another program is already using that port"* | A server is still running from earlier - close it. Or change `addr` in `config.yaml`. |
| The web portal will not open | Check the address the server printed; it does not always use port 80. |
| *"No game data ... fights are unavailable"* | The `data` folder next to `arena-server` got separated from it, or `--data`/`data_dir` points somewhere empty - see step 3. |
| Client cannot connect | The server window must still be running. Allow it through the firewall when asked. |
| Forgot who the admin is | The first account registered. To start over, stop the server and delete `arena.db` (this erases everything). |

## Updating

The server tells you at startup when a newer version is out. To update, download
the new archive and replace `arena-server` - keep your `config.yaml`, `arena.db`
and `data` folder.

To turn that check off, set `enabled: false` under `update_check:` in
`config.yaml`. It only ever performs one anonymous request to GitHub's public
release page; nothing about your server or your players is sent, and nothing is
downloaded or installed automatically.

## Verifying your download

Each release ships a `checksums.txt`.

```
# Linux / macOS
sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# Windows PowerShell
Get-FileHash .\arena-server_v0.1.0_windows_amd64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the result with the matching line in `checksums.txt`.
